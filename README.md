  ## Description 

  The team profile generator app is a command-line interface (CLI) application that helps to generate a webpage that displays the members of a software engineering team. The app prompts the user to enter information about the manager, engineers, and interns of the team and generates an HTML file with a nicely formatted page displaying the team members' information, including their names, roles, IDs, email addresses, and specific information depending on their role.

  The generated page uses Bootstrap CSS to make the cards with the team members' information look professional and visually appealing. The app is easy to use and saves time in generating a webpage for your team's profiles.
